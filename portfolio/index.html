			<h2><span style="background-color: lightblue"><em>About Me</em></span></h2>

			<p>I'm a <strong>quickly learning, detail-oriented, hard worker</strong> seeking a rewarding, societally beneficial career. I graduated <strong>Magna Cum Laude</strong> with a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Sam Houston State University in May 2016, but have been struggling to find my professional footing since. I'm looking forward to making a career in the software development field, where I'll get a chance to use my <strong>sharp logic and reasoning skills</strong> to create apps and programs that will help my fellow man.</p>

			<!-- need to elaborate more here -->

			<p>"Intro to Programming Fundamentals" was a required class for all B.S. students. We learned the basics of how OOP languages work and gained an intermediate understanding of Java. <strong>I made over 100% in this class</strong>, after bonus points on the tests. Fun fact, this site is being made using TextPad, the code editor we used in that class. </p>

			<p>I also learned a bit of Perl and LaTeX in my Theoretical Physics class.</p>

			<p>I've recieved accolades for some of the writing I did in college. SHSU's Writing Center takes essay submissions from all professors for a college-wide writing contest every year, and my English Composition I & II professor submitted <strong>four</strong> of my essays. My personal narrative was nominated for <strong>Best Freshman Essay</strong>, and I recieved an <strong>Excellence in Writing</strong> certificate for my advertisement analysis.

			<p>I love music. I was in the choir all through middle and high school, so I'm a decent singer, and I can dabble on the guitar and piano. Of the times I've gone out in the past few years, probably 80% of them were for concerts. I can find something I like from every genre, but mostly I enjoy a wide range of rock music, from bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311 all the way to the likes of Pantera and Amon Amarth. I also enjoy a few subgenres of EDM, and the occasional pop star that comes along. Right now, that pop star is Billie Eilish. "You Should See Me in a Crown" is my <strong>JAM.</strong></p>

			<p>I'm also a big fan of puzzles. I've been doing Sudoku for over a decade, but over the years I've added Hitori, Tic Tac Toe Logic, Minesweeper, and room escapes to my repertoire. I have a Nikola Tesla themed puzzle book that actually includes a few types of puzzles that were presented in Genesis10's logic and reasoning test. <strong>Yes, I do stuff like that test for fun.</strong></p>

			<p>I watch entirely too much TV and may have a slight video game addiction. My favorite show is Bojack Horseman, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a close second. I also like Rick and Morty, Archer, Dollface, American Dad, and a few others in that realm. I'm a big fan of game shows, too; my favorites there are Cash Cab, Jeopardy! (I'm a trivia fan as well), Netflix's new one called Awake, and Billy on the Street.</p>

			<p>I've never been a huge fan of most physical activity, but my family spends as much of the summer as we can at the lake, and as a result I've developed an interest in <a href="https://www.wakeboardingmag.com/" target="_blank">wakeboarding</a>. I also enjoy dancing and have considered joining a Zumba class or something similar to help maintain my physical health, because God knows I'm not going to just...work out. I definitely need something to balance out my love of food.</p>
